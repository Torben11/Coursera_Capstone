This repository is divided in :
* A report of the project
* A jupyter notebook with the source code

Since github doesn't show folium maps, to visualize the notebook fully, we're going to use a jupyter notebook viewer. [Click Here to visualize the notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Torben11/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Capstone_Project/FLN_Capstone_Project.ipynb)
